// lib/scheduling/calendar-sync.ts
// Keeps Calendly (and anything else that reads the priest's calendar) in step
// with Nepsis bookings.
//
// Calendly's API cannot block time — busy times are read-only — so Nepsis
// never talks to Calendly. What Calendly DOES do, on every plan, is hide any
// slot that collides with an event on the calendar it is connected to. So the
// bridge is the priest's own calendar: confirmed Nepsis appointments are
// written into a device calendar he picks — the same Google/iCloud/Outlook
// calendar his Calendly checks for conflicts — and Calendly closes those times
// by itself. No Calendly credentials, no backend, works on the free plan.
//
// Everything here runs on the PRIEST's device (confirming is his action), and
// state is per-account device storage: the chosen calendar id only means
// something on this phone, and the appointment→event map lets a cancellation
// take its event back out. reconcile() is self-healing — run on every Schedule
// load, it adds events any earlier attempt missed, re-adds ones deleted by
// hand on the calendar, and removes events whose appointment has since been
// cancelled or declined. Only FUTURE times matter: past events are history and
// are neither written, deleted, nor tracked.
