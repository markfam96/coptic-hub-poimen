// lib/reminders/content.ts
// What a reminder says on a given day.
//
// A reminder that reads "Don't forget your canon!" every evening is noise, and
// noise gets notifications switched off — or, worse, ignored while staying on,
// which is the same thing with extra guilt attached. So each day's reminder is
// built from that day's actual rule and that day's actual review queue, names
// one or two real items, and is NOT SCHEDULED AT ALL on a day with nothing due.
// Silence on an empty day is a feature: it is what makes the reminder mean
// something on a full one.
//
// Everything here reads from the same local stores the Canon and Psalms tabs
// read, so it is accurate offline and costs nothing to compute.
//
// THE STORES ARE READ ONCE, NOT ONCE PER DAY. The window is fourteen days and
// the rule behind it does not change between them, so loading it per day meant
// fourteen reads of every store and — because a Father of Confession's
// assignments come from the server — fourteen network round trips for one
// rebuild. That ran on every change to a reminder time, while the control that
// triggered it was disabled, which is what made the time picker feel like it
// had a floor at 6pm. It did not; the taps were being dropped.
