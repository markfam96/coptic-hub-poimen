// lib/reminders/schedule.ts
// Scheduling the local reminders for the Canon and the Psalms.
//
// LOCAL notifications only. There is no push token, no device registration and
// no server involvement of any kind: the phone is told once what to say and
// when, and it says it even in airplane mode. That is not only simpler — it is
// the only version of this feature consistent with what the app promises about
// confession and canon data, since a push server would mean a server that knows
// what someone's rule asks of them and when they have not done it.
//
// WHY A ROLLING WINDOW rather than one repeating daily trigger: a repeating
// trigger can only ever carry one fixed sentence, which is how reminders become
// wallpaper. Scheduling WINDOW_DAYS days individually lets each day carry its
// own real content — the two services actually due, the number of portions
// actually up for review — and lets a day with nothing due stay silent. The
// window is topped up every time the app comes to the foreground, so an active
// member is always a fortnight ahead. Someone who stops opening the app stops
// being reminded after two weeks, which is the correct end state: a phone that
// nags indefinitely about a rule no one is keeping is not pastoral care.
